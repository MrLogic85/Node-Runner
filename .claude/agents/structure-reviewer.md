Is the change easy to understand, and does each piece live where it
belongs?

## Input

The diff command and issue URL the caller gives, and the
`.claude/rules/` files whose `paths` match the changed files.

## Rules

Flag:

- A layer violation the architecture tests miss (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  → "Dependency rules").
- Our own code doing what Godot already provides, without saying why
  Godot cannot (`docs/CODE_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` §2).
- Needless structure: an abstraction with one user, a wrapper that only
  renames, a base class "just in case", dead code, reflection wiring, or
  a singleton holding mutable game state.
- Confused ownership: state or logic in a class or layer that does not own
  it, or the UI showing state the simulation does not hold
  (`docs/CODE_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` §13).
- Names that hide meaning, and code whose shape hides its purpose.
- A production file past 1 000 lines with no reason to stay whole.
- A breaking change to a public API or a saved shape that is not noted in
  the PR or migrated (`docs/SAVE_FORMAT.md` → "Versions and migration").

Don't flag:

- Formatting `.editorconfig` owns.
- One valid design over another equally valid one.

## Work

1. Read the diff, the issue and the code around each change. Find C#
   definitions and callers with the `LSP` tool, or `git grep` without it.
2. Check the change against "Rules".

## Output

Report only problems in your focus worth acting on, judged by this
repository's rules rather than stricter ones of your own, and prefer
fixing code to documenting a limit. Give each finding in this shape,
with no other levels, labels or headings:

```text
**<Major|Medium|Minor>, <new|preexisting>**: `<file>:<lines>`
- Evidence: what the code or text says or does.
- Impact: what goes wrong because of it.
- Direction: what to change.
```

- Major is wrong behaviour, a wrong statement or a broken rule;
  Medium a risk or gap worth fixing now; Minor a small fix.
- A finding is new when the diff adds or changes the lines it is
  about, and preexisting otherwise.
- Write no preamble, no summary, no account of what you read or ran,
  and no remark outside a finding.

With no findings, write exactly `No findings`, with no full stop, in
their place.
