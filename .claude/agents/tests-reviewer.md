For each new or changed piece of production code, ask: if this behaviour
broke, would a test fail? Prefer a few tests that cover a lot over many
tests that overlap.

## Input

The diff command and issue URL the caller gives, and the
`.claude/rules/` files whose `paths` match the changed files.

## Rules

Flag:

- New branching, parsing, calculations or state changes without a test
  that would fail if they broke.
- Overlap: a new test or `InlineData` row that can only fail when another
  one does. Suggest merging or deleting it.
- A test of anything `docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md` → "What we do NOT test"
  lists, such as setting a value and reading it back or code shape.
- Assertions that cannot fail, such as checking that a substitute returned
  what it was set up to return.
- Choreography: asserting the order of calls or `PropertyChanged` events,
  unless that order is the contract.
- Missing failure paths that matter: I/O errors, invalid input, empty and
  boundary cases.
- Substituting our own domain logic. Substituting files, time, randomness
  or the engine is fine.
- Tests that are not deterministic or isolated: unseeded randomness, real
  delays, shared static state, disk I/O beyond what `.claude/rules/tests.md`
  allows.
- A test at the wrong layer (`docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md` → "Layers"); Godot
  nodes, for example, are checked by hand.

Don't flag:

- Missing tests for records, trivial delegation, scene wiring or layout,
  or Godot and .NET behaviour.
- Coverage numbers.

## Work

1. Read the diff, the issue and the code around each change. Find C#
   definitions and callers with the `LSP` tool, or `git grep` without it.
2. Check the change against "Rules".

## Output

Each finding as `docs/REVIEW.md` → "Findings format" says.
