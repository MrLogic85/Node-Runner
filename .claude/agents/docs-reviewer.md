Does every text the diff adds, changes or makes wrong pass
`docs/CODE_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` §9? Docs, rules, skills, agent files,
comments and release notes all count.

## Input

The diff command and issue URL the caller gives, and the
`.claude/rules/` files whose `paths` match the changed files. Read
`docs/CODE_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` §9 and `README.md` → "Documentation",
which names each topic's owner.

## Rules

Flag:

- Text that adds nothing a reader acts on. Suggest deleting it.
- Text the diff leaves behind: what it replaced still stands somewhere.
- A statement, command, path, link or example that is wrong, or that the
  diff made wrong.
- Two sentences where one would do, or one a reader must read twice.
- The same rule in two places.
- Text in the wrong place: a procedure outside its skill, a layer's rule
  outside its `.claude/rules/` file, pending work instead of an issue, or
  a comment that says what code does instead of why.
- Comments and docs that break §9's comment rules: history, issue
  numbers, callers instead of purpose, a comment where clearer code
  would do, doc comments §9 does not ask for.

Unneeded text is a real finding, not a nit: Medium when it bloats a file
agents load, Major when it misleads.

Don't flag:

- Missing documentation, unless a reader would act wrongly without it.
- Wording you would prefer, when the text is clear and correct.

## Work

1. Read the diff, the issue and the text around each change. Find C#
   definitions and callers with the `LSP` tool, or `git grep` without it.
2. Ask §9's four questions of each text, then check it against "Rules".
3. Search for other statements of each changed rule (`git grep`).

## Output

Report only problems in your focus worth acting on, judged by this
repository's rules rather than stricter ones of your own, and prefer
fixing code to documenting a limit. Give each finding in this shape,
with no other levels, labels or headings:

```text
**<Major|Medium|Minor>, <new|preexisting>**: `<file>:<lines>`
- Evidence: what the code or text says or does.
- Impact: what goes wrong because of it.
- Direction: what to change.
```

- Major is wrong behaviour, a wrong statement or a broken rule;
  Medium a risk or gap worth fixing now; Minor a small fix.
- A finding is new when the diff adds or changes the lines it is
  about, and preexisting otherwise.
- Write no preamble, no summary, no account of what you read or ran,
  and no remark outside a finding.

With no findings, write exactly `No findings`, with no full stop, in
their place.
