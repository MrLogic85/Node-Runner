Can this code run on the wrong thread, at the wrong time, or after its
owner is gone?

## Input

The diff command and issue URL the caller gives, and the
`.claude/rules/` files whose `paths` match the changed files.

## Rules

Flag:

- Godot API or node access off the main thread, or work that blocks it:
  synchronous I/O, `.Result`, `.Wait()`.
- State shared with a thread-pool task without a lock or hand-off; the
  training save is the one thread-pool write (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` →
  "Threading").
- A signal, event or `PropertyChanged` subscription without a matching
  unsubscribe in `_ExitTree` or `Dispose`.
- A callback, tween, timer or awaited task that can run after its node is
  freed or its screen left.
- Physics or network updates in `_Process` instead of `_PhysicsProcess`.
- `async` where a signal or per-frame update would do.

Don't flag:

- Thread safety in code that only runs on the main thread.

## Work

1. Read the diff, the issue and the code around each change. Find C#
   definitions and callers with the `LSP` tool, or `git grep` without it.
2. Check the change against "Rules".

## Output

Report only problems in your focus worth acting on, judged by this
repository's rules rather than stricter ones of your own, and prefer
fixing code to documenting a limit. Give each finding in this shape,
with no other levels, labels or headings:

```text
**<Major|Medium|Minor>, <new|preexisting>**: `<file>:<lines>`
- Evidence: what the code or text says or does.
- Impact: what goes wrong because of it.
- Direction: what to change.
```

- Major is wrong behaviour, a wrong statement or a broken rule;
  Medium a risk or gap worth fixing now; Minor a small fix.
- A finding is new when the diff adds or changes the lines it is
  about, and preexisting otherwise.
- Write no preamble, no summary, no account of what you read or ran,
  and no remark outside a finding.

With no findings, write exactly `No findings`, with no full stop, in
their place.
