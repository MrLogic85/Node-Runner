When this fails, does someone find out, and is the state still valid?

## Input

The diff command and issue URL the caller gives, and the
`.claude/rules/` files whose `paths` match the changed files.

## Rules

Flag:

- Swallowed errors: an empty `catch`, a broad `catch` that hides the
  cause, or an ignored return value or exit code.
- Misleading success: reporting done when part of the work failed.
- Partial state: a save, file or object left half-written when a step
  fails.
- Lost context: an error logged or rethrown without its cause, path or
  value.
- Unchecked input at a boundary: files, share codes, imported creations.
- An invariant without a `Debug.Assert`, or a release build that crashes
  where it should clamp and log (`docs/CODE_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` §8).

Don't flag:

- Checks for states the types already rule out, or defensive code for
  failures that cannot happen.

## Work

1. Read the diff, the issue and the code around each change. Find C#
   definitions and callers with the `LSP` tool, or `git grep` without it.
2. Check the change against "Rules".

## Output

Report only problems in your focus worth acting on, judged by this
repository's rules rather than stricter ones of your own, and prefer
fixing code to documenting a limit. Give each finding in this shape,
with no other levels, labels or headings:

```text
**<Major|Medium|Minor>, <new|preexisting>**: `<file>:<lines>`
- Evidence: what the code or text says or does.
- Impact: what goes wrong because of it.
- Direction: what to change.
```

- Major is wrong behaviour, a wrong statement or a broken rule;
  Medium a risk or gap worth fixing now; Minor a small fix.
- A finding is new when the diff adds or changes the lines it is
  about, and preexisting otherwise.
- Write no preamble, no summary, no account of what you read or ran,
  and no remark outside a finding.

With no findings, write exactly `No findings`, with no full stop, in
their place.
