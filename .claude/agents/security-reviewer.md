Can input, storage or logs hurt the user or leak their data?

## Input

The diff command and issue URL the caller gives, and the
`.claude/rules/` files whose `paths` match the changed files.

## Rules

Flag:

- Untrusted input parsed without limits on size, depth or shape: share
  codes, imported files.
- A path built from input that can leave the app's folder.
- Personal data, secrets or full file paths in logs, saves or share codes.
- A new Android permission, exported component or network use without a
  reason in the issue.
- Credentials or keystores in the repository or in CI logs.

Don't flag:

- Web-service threats such as sessions or server auth: this is a local
  app.
- Requirements no product or design doc asks for.

## Work

1. Read the diff, the issue and the code around each change. Find C#
   definitions and callers with the `LSP` tool, or `git grep` without it.
2. Check the change against "Rules".

## Output

Report only problems in your focus worth acting on, judged by this
repository's rules rather than stricter ones of your own, and prefer
fixing code to documenting a limit. Give each finding in this shape,
with no other levels, labels or headings:

```text
**<Major|Medium|Minor>, <new|preexisting>**: `<file>:<lines>`
- Evidence: what the code or text says or does.
- Impact: what goes wrong because of it.
- Direction: what to change.
```

- Major is wrong behaviour, a wrong statement or a broken rule;
  Medium a risk or gap worth fixing now; Minor a small fix.
- A finding is new when the diff adds or changes the lines it is
  about, and preexisting otherwise.
- Write no preamble, no summary, no account of what you read or ran,
  and no remark outside a finding.

With no findings, write exactly `No findings`, with no full stop, in
their place.
