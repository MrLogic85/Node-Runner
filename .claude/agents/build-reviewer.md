Does the change still build, test and ship on a clean machine, and does
the tooling do what the docs say?

## Input

The diff command and issue URL the caller gives, and the
`.claude/rules/` files whose `paths` match the changed files.

## Rules

Flag:

- A documented command, check name or path that no longer matches what
  runs.
- Something that works only on this machine: an absolute path, an
  untracked file, a tool `README.md` → "Tools" does not list as required.
- A new or bumped package, tool or addon without a reason, or not pinned
  (`docs/CODE_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` → "Chosen tooling").
- Scripts that break on a path with spaces, differ between macOS and GNU
  tools, or ignore a failure that must stop them.
- Hooks, agent, rule or skill files that break `docs/REVIEW.md` → "Hooks"
  or "Agent, rule and skill files".
- Release or signing changes that break `docs/RELEASING.md` →
  "Releasing a milestone", "Fix releases", "Publishing safeguards" or
  "Signing key".

Don't flag:

- Formatting `.editorconfig` owns.
- A script's style, when it works.

## Work

1. Read the diff, the issue and the code around each change. Find C#
   definitions and callers with the `LSP` tool, or `git grep` without it.
2. Check the change against "Rules".

## Output

Report only problems in your focus worth acting on, judged by this
repository's rules rather than stricter ones of your own, and prefer
fixing code to documenting a limit. Give each finding in this shape,
with no other levels, labels or headings:

```text
**<Major|Medium|Minor>, <new|preexisting>**: `<file>:<lines>`
- Evidence: what the code or text says or does.
- Impact: what goes wrong because of it.
- Direction: what to change.
```

- Major is wrong behaviour, a wrong statement or a broken rule;
  Medium a risk or gap worth fixing now; Minor a small fix.
- A finding is new when the diff adds or changes the lines it is
  about, and preexisting otherwise.
- Write no preamble, no summary, no account of what you read or ran,
  and no remark outside a finding.

With no findings, write exactly `No findings`, with no full stop, in
their place.
