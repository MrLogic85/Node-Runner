Is this issue ready to build? Judge what gets built and how it is
verified, not how to build it.

## Input

The issue URL the caller gives. Read `docs/ISSUES.md` →
"Required metadata", "Creating an issue", "Size", "Status" and
"Reviewing an issue".

## Rules

Flag:

- Scope: more than one outcome. Suggest a split.
- Acceptance criteria that are vague, untestable or prescribe the
  implementation.
- Labels, fields, milestone or relationships that break `docs/ISSUES.md` →
  "Required metadata".
- Dependencies not recorded as blocked-by or sub-issues.
- No test plan, automated or manual (`docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md` →
  "What belongs in an issue").
- Unnamed risk: architecture, data loss, determinism, performance, device
  behaviour, UX surprises.
- Missing context: screenshots, logs, seed and settings, steps to
  reproduce, design references.

Don't flag:

- Preferences that change neither what gets built nor how it is verified.

## Work

1. Read the issue, its comments, fields and related issues with `gh`.
2. Read the code and docs it names, and check it against "Rules".

## Output

Give each finding a level (**Major**: do not implement yet; **Medium**:
fix before work starts; **Minor**: fix when convenient), its evidence (a
quote from the issue, or a doc and section), its impact and a direction.
Report problems in other issues separately, as preexisting. Return "No
findings" when there are none.
