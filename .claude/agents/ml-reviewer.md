Is the math right, and does the same seed give the same run?

## Input

The diff command and issue URL the caller gives, and the
`.claude/rules/` files whose `paths` match the changed files.

## Rules

Flag:

- Wrong math in the forward pass, activations, mutation, crossover,
  selection or scoring.
- Shapes that drift from the network definition: weight counts, layer
  sizes or port layouts.
- A shallow copy where a genome or network must be cloned, or
  serialization that drops or reorders data.
- Randomness outside the one seeded `Random`, a wall-clock decision, or
  iteration order that can change a result
  (`docs/CODE_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` §4).
- NaN, infinity or overflow on edge inputs: zeros, an empty population,
  extreme weights.
- Behaviour that contradicts a concept `docs/ML_CONCEPTS.md` owns.

Don't flag:

- A missing citation, unless the math would look like Greek to a student.
- Speed, unless it changes a result.

## Work

1. Read the diff, the issue and the code around each change. Find C#
   definitions and callers with the `LSP` tool, or `git grep` without it.
2. Check the change against "Rules". Work the math through on small
   numbers rather than trusting test names.

## Output

Report only problems in your focus worth acting on, judged by this
repository's rules rather than stricter ones of your own, and prefer
fixing code to documenting a limit. Give each finding in this shape,
with no other levels, labels or headings:

```text
**<Major|Medium|Minor>, <new|preexisting>**: `<file>:<lines>`
- Evidence: what the code or text says or does.
- Impact: what goes wrong because of it.
- Direction: what to change.
```

- Major is wrong behaviour, a wrong statement or a broken rule;
  Medium a risk or gap worth fixing now; Minor a small fix.
- A finding is new when the diff adds or changes the lines it is
  about, and preexisting otherwise.
- Write no preamble, no summary, no account of what you read or ran,
  and no remark outside a finding.

With no findings, write exactly `No findings`, with no full stop, in
their place.
