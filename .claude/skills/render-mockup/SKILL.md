description: Render a Node Runner design proposal as one PNG mockup per alternative, in Neon and Paper, from HTML/SVG with the app's tokens. Use when a design choice needs pictures before the human can decide.

# Render a mockup

`docs/UI_DIRECTION.md` owns the look. A mockup is a sketch for a decision,
not the app; check a built screen with the `desktop-check` skill instead.

1. Create the proposal's folder: `mkdir -p .scratch/design-<topic>`.
2. Write one HTML file per alternative, each showing Neon and Paper side
   by side at the smallest canvas, 640 × 360, unless the proposal needs
   another ratio (`docs/UI_DIRECTION.md` → "Screen size and safe area").
   Take every value from the app:
   - colours: the `NodeRunner/colors/<token>` entries in
     `project/assets/themes/Neon.tres` and `Paper.tres`;
   - type: the `Ui<Style>` font sizes and fonts there, with `@font-face`
     rules pointing at `project/assets/fonts/` by absolute `file://` URL;
   - sizes, spacing, radii and panel widths: `UiSize.cs`, `UiSpacing.cs`
     and `UiLayout.cs` in `project/src/ui/lib/`, and the screen scene
     being changed.

   Label each image with the alternative's name and "Sketch", and mark the
   recommended one.
3. Render each file in one shell call, which finds Chrome itself; set
   `CHROME` to name another browser, or `CHROME=none` to force step 4.
   `size` is the whole page's CSS size, both themes and labels included;
   the PNG comes out at twice that, for sharpness:

   ```bash
   dir="$PWD/.scratch/design-<topic>" name=<option> size=<width>,<height>
   chrome="${CHROME:-$(command -v google-chrome chromium | head -1)}"
   mac="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
   if [ -z "$chrome" ] && [ -x "$mac" ]; then chrome="$mac"; fi
   if [ -z "$chrome" ] || [ "$chrome" = none ]; then echo "not rendered: no Chrome"; else
     rm -f "$dir/$name.png"
     "$chrome" --headless=new --disable-gpu --hide-scrollbars \
       --force-device-scale-factor=2 --virtual-time-budget=3000 \
       --window-size="$size" --screenshot="$dir/$name.png" \
       "file://$dir/$name.html" 2>"$dir/$name.log" && test -s "$dir/$name.png" \
       && echo "rendered: $dir/$name.png" || echo "not rendered: see $dir/$name.log"
   fi
   ```

   Look at each image; fix the HTML and render again until it shows what
   you mean.
4. When it prints "not rendered" and the log shows no fix, report the
   HTML files instead and say they are not rendered.
5. Delete everything in the folder except the files you report. Reply
   with their paths, which one is recommended, and that the caller deletes
   the folder once the human has seen them or they are posted to the
   issue.
