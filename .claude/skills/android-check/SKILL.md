name: android-check
description: Export, install and run the Node Runner debug build on an Android phone or emulator, load a test creation, capture screenshots and logcat as evidence, and leave the device as it was found. Use when a manual test plan has Android steps or a change touches export, install, input, file paths or performance.

# Android check

`docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md` owns when an Android check is needed, which
device to use and what counts as evidence ("Android checks", "Agent-run
manual tests"); `docs/RELEASING.md` → "Android export" owns the export.
This skill owns how to run one. Each shell call starts afresh, so every
block below sets the variables it uses.

1. **Pick the device** as "Android checks" says, and follow the device
   rules in `LOCAL_CONFIG.md`, including any local skill it names, until
   step 7 is done. Note the serial of an emulator you start. With more
   than one device in `adb devices -l`, add `ANDROID_SERIAL=<serial>` to
   each block.
2. **Note how you found it**, for step 7. The block records one state:
   `not-installed`, `never-ran` (installed, with no saved files yet) or
   `before.txt` (the creation folders). If it records none, stop and ask
   the human: adb or `run-as` failed, or the app holds saves but no
   creations. It refuses to run while an earlier check's state is left;
   finish that check's step 7 first.

   ```bash
   pkg=dev.mrlogic85.noderunner.debug s=.scratch/android
   mkdir -p .scratch && rm -f "$s-packages.txt" "$s-files.txt" "$s-list.txt"
   ! ls "$s-not-installed" "$s-never-ran" "$s-before.txt" 2> /dev/null | grep -q . &&
     adb get-state | grep -qx device &&
     adb shell pm list packages "$pkg" > "$s-packages.txt" &&
     if ! grep -qx "package:$pkg" "$s-packages.txt"; then touch "$s-not-installed"
     elif adb shell run-as "$pkg" ls files > "$s-files.txt"; then
       if [ ! -s "$s-files.txt" ]; then touch "$s-never-ran"
       elif grep -qx creations "$s-files.txt" &&
         adb shell run-as "$pkg" ls files/creations > "$s-list.txt"; then
         mv "$s-list.txt" "$s-before.txt"
       fi
     fi
   ls "$s"-not-installed "$s"-never-ran "$s"-before.txt 2>/dev/null
   ```

3. **Export, install and launch.** Delete the old APK so a failed export
   cannot install it, run the debug export from `docs/RELEASING.md` →
   "Android export", then install. `logcat -c` clears the whole device
   log, not just the app's.

   ```bash
   pkg=dev.mrlogic85.noderunner.debug
   rm -f build/node-runner-debug.apk
   # the debug export from docs/RELEASING.md → "Android export"
   test -f build/node-runner-debug.apk &&
     adb install -r build/node-runner-debug.apk &&
     adb logcat -c &&
     adb shell monkey -p "$pkg" -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
   ```

   `install -r` keeps the app's saves. If it fails with a signature
   mismatch, ask the human: uninstalling would delete their creations.
4. **Load a test creation** when the plan needs one, such as
   `tests/NodeRunner.App.Tests/Repositories/SaveExamples/0.13.0/walker.creation.json`
   (`docs/SAVE_FORMAT.md` → "Layout" says where saves live). Its folder is
   its `id` without dashes; the block refuses an id the device already
   has, so pick another creation if it stops.

   ```bash
   pkg=dev.mrlogic85.noderunner.debug f=<creation.json>
   id=$(jq -r .id "$f" | tr -d -)
   [[ $id =~ ^[0-9a-f]{32}$ ]] &&
     adb push "$f" /data/local/tmp/nr-creation.json &&
     adb shell run-as "$pkg" sh -c "'test ! -e files/creations/$id && mkdir -p files/creations/$id && cp /data/local/tmp/nr-creation.json files/creations/$id/creation.json'" &&
     adb shell am force-stop "$pkg" &&
     adb shell monkey -p "$pkg" -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
   ```

   The relaunch makes the app read its creations again. A share code
   (`docs/SAVE_FORMAT.md` → "Share code") is the in-app alternative.
5. **Run the steps and capture evidence.** Take screenshots with
   `adb exec-out screencap -p > .scratch/<step>.png`. Look at each before
   judging the step, and before sharing it: the whole screen is captured,
   so retake or crop one that shows notifications or another app.
   `adb shell input tap X Y` and `adb shell input swipe X1 Y1 X2 Y2 MS` use
   the screenshot file's pixels; scale a point read off a downsized view.
   Collect the log, and check the app is still running:

   ```bash
   adb logcat -d -s godot:V AndroidRuntime:E DEBUG:F libc:F > .scratch/logcat.txt
   adb shell pidof dev.mrlogic85.noderunner.debug
   ```

   Read the log for `ERROR`, `SCRIPT ERROR`, exceptions and fatal
   signals. Godot logs its warnings at level `E` too.
6. **Record the run** in the PR's **How to verify** as
   `docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md` → "What belongs in a PR" lists, with the device
   model (`adb shell getprop ro.product.model`) and Android version
   (`adb shell getprop ro.build.version.release`).
7. **Leave the device as you found it**, also when the check fails or
   stops early. Stop the app first, since the Build screen saves on exit,
   then undo what step 2 recorded. Only the install, the creation folders
   and the files above are restored; avoid opening the human's own
   creations, since the app may save them.

   ```bash
   pkg=dev.mrlogic85.noderunner.debug s=.scratch/android
   adb shell am force-stop "$pkg"
   adb shell rm -f /data/local/tmp/nr-creation.json
   if [ -f "$s-not-installed" ]; then
     adb shell pm list packages "$pkg" > "$s-now.txt" &&
       { ! grep -qx "package:$pkg" "$s-now.txt" || adb uninstall "$pkg"; } && rm -f "$s"-*
   elif [ -f "$s-never-ran" ]; then adb shell pm clear "$pkg" && rm -f "$s"-*
   elif [ -f "$s-before.txt" ]; then
     adb shell run-as "$pkg" ls files/creations | grep -E '^[0-9a-f]{32}$' | grep -vxFf "$s-before.txt" |
       while read -r id; do adb shell run-as "$pkg" rm -r "files/creations/$id" < /dev/null; done
     adb shell run-as "$pkg" ls files/creations > "$s-after.txt" &&
       diff "$s-before.txt" "$s-after.txt" && rm -f "$s"-*
   else echo "step 2 recorded no state: ask the human"
   fi
   ```

   The step is done when the `.scratch/android-*` files are gone.

   Then release the device as `LOCAL_CONFIG.md`'s rules say, stop an
   emulator you started as "Android checks" says, and delete
   `build/node-runner-debug.apk` and the other scratch files.
