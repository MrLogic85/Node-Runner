# Review a change

Rules: `docs/REVIEW.md` → "Choosing reviewers", "Review receipts" and
"Definition of Done".

1. Fix the exact change under review, as "Review receipts" measures it:
   - before the commit: stage it with `git add -A`, or name its paths
     when an untracked file that is not part of it must stay out, then
     `git diff --cached "$(.github/scripts/review-receipt.sh base)"`;
   - after it: `git diff "$(.github/scripts/review-receipt.sh base)" HEAD`;
   - someone else's PR: `gh pr diff N`.
2. Select the reviewers by "Choosing reviewers".
3. Run the selected agents in parallel as subagents, each with this
   prompt; run `design-lead` after the others have finished ("Choosing
   reviewers"), and in its prompt replace `Reply with findings only.`
   with a sentence saying whether the phone is free. If it is, claim any
   device lock before `design-lead` starts and release it when it
   returns:

   ```text
   Review `<diff command>` for <issue URL>. Reply with findings only.
   ```
4. Judge each finding as "Definition of Done" says: fix it, or dismiss it
   with a short reason. File an issue with the `create-issue` skill only
   where it asks for one.
5. After a fix that changes behaviour or design, repeat steps 1, 3 and 4
   on the new diff with only the reviewers the fix selects ("Review
   receipts").
6. For your own change, record the receipt. Write each reviewer's
   findings and their dispositions, or "No findings", and for each fix
   whether it was re-reviewed or simple, to
   `.scratch/review.md`, stage the change as in step 1, then run:

   ```bash
   .github/scripts/review-receipt.sh write --reviewers docs-reviewer,tests-reviewer .scratch/review.md
   ```

   naming every reviewer that ran. Keep the file for the PR body.
7. Commit and ship it with the `ship-pr` skill.
