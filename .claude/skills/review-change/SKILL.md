# Review a change

`docs/REVIEW.md` → "Review agents" owns which reviewer a diff selects and
how they report, "Review receipts" owns when review runs and what a push
needs, and "Definition of Done" owns the gate; this skill owns the steps.

1. Fix the exact change under review, as "Review receipts" measures it:
   - before the commit: stage it with `git add -A`, or name its paths
     when an untracked file that is not part of it must stay out, then
     `git diff --cached "$(.github/scripts/review-receipt.sh base)"`;
   - after it: `git diff "$(.github/scripts/review-receipt.sh base)" HEAD`;
   - someone else's PR: `gh pr diff N`.
2. Select the reviewers by "Choosing reviewers".
3. Run the selected agents in parallel as subagents. Give each the
   repository path, the exact diff command and the issue URL, and give
   `design-lead` the evidence "Choosing reviewers" names.
4. Judge each finding as "Definition of Done" says: fix it, or dismiss it
   with a short reason. File an issue with the `create-issue` skill only
   where it asks for one.
5. After a fix that changes behaviour or design, repeat steps 1, 3 and 4
   on the new diff with only the reviewers the corrective change selects
   ("Review receipts"). A simple, local fix needs no new review.
6. For your own change, record the receipt. Write each reviewer's
   findings and their dispositions, or "No findings", and for each fix
   whether it was re-reviewed or simple, to
   `.scratch/review.md`, stage the change as in step 1, then run:

   ```bash
   .github/scripts/review-receipt.sh write --reviewers docs-reviewer,tests-reviewer .scratch/review.md
   ```

   naming every reviewer that ran. Keep the file for the PR body.
7. Commit and ship it with the `ship-pr` skill.
