# Release a milestone

`docs/RELEASING.md` → "Releasing a milestone" owns the rules and the
PRs' titles. Read `LOCAL_CONFIG.md` first for the `gh` login and the
signing key.

1. Stop unless the human has asked for this release. Find the release
   issue `#N` and check it is the milestone's last open issue; if others
   are open, stop and report them:

   ```bash
   gh issue list --milestone X.Y.Z --state open
   ```

2. Write the notes with the `write-release-notes` skill and ship them as
   the notes PR with the `ship-pr` skill. Unlike other PRs, wait for this
   one, `P` being the number `gh pr create` printed: `release.sh` needs
   its merge commit's checks to pass on `main`. If a check fails, fix it
   as `ship-pr` step 6 says and wait again; if it reports no checks yet,
   wait and run it again.

   ```bash
   gh pr checks P --watch --fail-fast || exit 1
   until s=$(gh pr view P --json state -q .state) && [ "$s" != OPEN ]; do sleep 15; done
   [ "$s" = MERGED ] || exit 1   # closed unmerged: stop and ask the human
   sha=$(gh pr view P --json mergeCommit -q .mergeCommit.oid)
   until id=$(gh run list --commit "$sha" --limit 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId') && [ -n "$id" ]; do sleep 10; done
   gh run watch "$id" --exit-status
   ```

3. Dry-run the release from an up-to-date `main`. It exports and checks
   the APK, but tags and publishes nothing:

   ```bash
   git switch main && git pull --ff-only
   .github/scripts/set-version.sh   # prints version X.Y.Z
   .github/scripts/release.sh --dry-run
   ```

4. Publish, then check the release page shows the notes and the APK. If
   the script stops, do what its message says ("Publishing safeguards").

   ```bash
   .github/scripts/release.sh
   gh release view vX.Y.Z
   ```

5. Find `<next>`, the lowest open milestone after X.Y.Z; if there is
   none, ask the human. On a branch, run
   `.github/scripts/set-version.sh <next>` and ship it as the bump PR
   with `ship-pr`.

   ```bash
   gh api 'repos/MrLogic85/Node-Runner/milestones?per_page=100' -q '.[].title' | sort -V
   ```

6. Delete the APK the release left in `build/`.
