# Tool rules — `project/src/tools/`

Developer tools run from the command line or the editor, never part of the
game.

## Rules

1. **Not shipped.** Each tool has a scene under `project/scenes/tools/`,
   which `export_presets.cfg` excludes from export. Nothing in the game may
   reference a tool.
2. **Thin.** A tool loads, calls library code, saves and quits. The logic
   lives in the layer it serves (such as `UiThemeExpander` in `ui/lib`),
   where it is tested.
3. **Fail loudly:** log the full exception and quit with exit code 1.

## Regenerating the themes

`ExpandThemes` regenerates the palette-derived items of the theme files.
Run it after editing a palette colour; `UiThemeExpanderTests` fail until
you do:

1. `dotnet build project/NodeRunner.csproj`.
2. `Godot --headless --path project res://scenes/tools/ExpandThemes.tscn`
   (on macOS, `/Applications/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`).
3. A command-line save drops the font `uid`s from `Neon.tres`'s
   `ext_resource` lines; restore them, or re-save in the editor, before
   committing.
