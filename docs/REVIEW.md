# Review process

How a change lands in `main`. The `start-issue`, `review-change` and
`ship-pr` skills hold the steps; this document holds the rules.

Every PR is reviewed by the review agents before it is pushed; Copilot
code review is not used. Human review is optional, and `nit:` comments
don't block.

## Definition of Done

A PR is mergeable when every box is true, or the PR says why a box does
not apply:

- [ ] A linked GitHub Issue and a closing keyword (release-notes PRs use
      `Part of`; `docs/RELEASING.md`)
- [ ] Required checks green (see "Merge gates"), and
      `dotnet build NodeRunner.slnx -warnaserror` clean, since CI does not
      fail on warnings in `project/`
- [ ] Tests as `docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md` asks
- [ ] Review agents ran on the final diff, and the author judged every
      new finding: a Major one is fixed, any other is fixed or dismissed
      with a short reason. Each preexisting finding is fixed here if it
      is simple (`docs/ISSUES.md` → "Creating an issue"); otherwise one of
      Medium or higher has an issue, and a lower one may be noted in the
      PR. For a UI-touching change, `design-lead`'s "insufficient
      evidence" blocks until a rerun reports evidence, or a human waiver
      is recorded in the PR.
- [ ] Docs and the matching `.claude/rules/` files updated where
      behaviour, architecture or a rule changed
- [ ] A change to a saved shape follows `docs/SAVE_FORMAT.md` →
      "Versions and migration"
- [ ] A breaking public API change is noted in the PR, and a change to
      `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` or `docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md` has a
      paragraph in the PR saying why
- [ ] No secrets, credentials or personal data
- [ ] PR title follows "PR title and commit hygiene"
- [ ] Manual testing decided and done per `docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md`
- [ ] Squash auto-merge enabled (see "Auto-merge")

## Choosing reviewers

Each review agent's focus is in `.claude/agents/<name>.md`. Select every
reviewer whose trigger the final diff touches; when unsure, include it.

| Agent | Selected when the diff touches |
|---|---|
| `docs-reviewer` | Docs, or behaviour, rules or commands that docs describe |
| `structure-reviewer` | Code, scenes or the solution layout |
| `ml-reviewer` | Networks, evolution, scoring, numerics or seeded randomness |
| `concurrency-reviewer` | Threads, tasks, async flow, signals, events or node lifecycle |
| `errors-reviewer` | Failure paths: I/O, parsing, validation, exceptions, invalid state |
| `security-reviewer` | Input, storage, logs, permissions, credentials or personal data |
| `tests-reviewer` | Tests, or logic that needs them |
| `performance-reviewer` | Per-frame or per-tick paths, training loops or long-lived state |
| `build-reviewer` | CI, scripts, project, package or editor config, agent, rule or skill files, or hooks |
| `design-lead` | Anything visible: screens, controls, layout, theme or world visuals |

`design-lead` runs after the other reviewers have finished: it builds and
runs the app, which would overlap their builds and tests.

## Review receipts

Review runs on the change as it will be committed, measured from where
the branch left `main`: before the commit on the staged change, after it
with no uncommitted change to a tracked file. Untracked files stay out,
as they stay out of the commit, so a human's untracked work need not be
staged or moved.

When no new finding is left unaddressed, `.github/scripts/review-receipt.sh
write` records a receipt in `.git/review-receipts/`: the branch, base and
tree, the reviewers that ran, and each finding with its disposition. It
refuses while a tracked file has unstaged changes.

The receipt's key hashes the diff from the merge base with `main` or
`origin/main`, so committing the reviewed content, or rebasing it onto a
newer `main` without touching its files, keeps it valid. Any other
change needs a new receipt. After a simple, local fix, such as a rename,
a reworded line or a test the finding spelled out, the receipt needs no
new review; after a fix that changes behaviour or design, the reviewers
the fix selects run again. The receipt says which applied. An empty
change needs no receipt.

`guard-bash.sh` denies a `git push` of a branch unless a receipt matches
what the branch holds. A commit earlier in the same command is
measured, unless it names paths; after any other git command that
changes what the push sends, run `git push` as its own command. Tags, deletes, dry runs and
`release/vX.Y` branches (`docs/RELEASING.md`) pass.

## Agent, rule and skill files

`AgentFilesSpec`, `RuleFilesSpec` and `SkillFilesSpec` in
`NodeRunner.Arch.Tests` check these rules, all but the last, which keep
each file loading in both Copilot CLI and Claude Code.

- Each agent is one `.claude/agents/<name>.md`. The folder holds nothing
  else but git-ignored `local_*` agents and dot-files, and there is no
  `.github/agents/`: Copilot would load it first and Claude Code not at
  all.
- An agent's frontmatter has only `name` (the file's `<name>`), a
  one-line `description`, `tools` and `hooks`, and never `model`. A value
  with `: ` or ` #` is invalid YAML unless quoted; prefer ` — `.
- A reviewer (`*-reviewer`) has `tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, LSP` and
  registers `reviewer-bash.sh` and `reviewer-lsp.sh` in its frontmatter
  in Claude Code's nested `hooks` shape, as the existing reviewers do:
  Claude Code drops an agent written in Copilot's flat shape. The
  matcher is `LSP|lsp`, since Copilot's matchers are case-sensitive.
  `design-lead` is no reviewer and keeps plain `Bash`, since it runs the
  app and writes screenshots and mockups in `.scratch/`.
- The `LSP` tool runs `csharp-ls`, pinned in `dotnet-tools.json`. Copilot
  reads `.github/lsp.json`, and Claude Code the `node-runner-csharp`
  plugin that `.claude/settings.json` enables from `.claude/marketplace/`;
  `LspConfigSpec` checks that they agree.
- A rule in `.claude/rules/<topic>.md` has frontmatter with only `paths`:
  at least one quoted glob, one per line, each an existing file or
  `<folder>/**`.
- Each skill is `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Its frontmatter has
  only `name`, the folder's name in lowercase letters, digits and hyphens
  (a git-ignored `local_*` skill keeps its underscore),
  at most 64 characters, and a one-line `description` of at most 1024
  characters saying what it does and when to use it, since the model
  matches tasks against it. A skill the instructions name exists.
- Committed instructions require only the tools `README.md` → "Tools"
  marks as required, and name a fallback for a recommended one, such as
  `git grep` for `rg`.

## Hooks

`.claude/settings.json` registers the scripts in `.claude/hooks/` for
every agent in both tools; only `reviewer-bash.sh` and `reviewer-lsp.sh`
are registered by each reviewer's frontmatter. They hold what an
instruction alone does not reliably hold:

| Event | Script | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionStart` | `session-start.sh` | Tells the agent the branch and any uncommitted changes, records the running emulators, and runs `dotnet tool restore` for the `LSP` tool, waiting at most `NODE_RUNNER_RESTORE_WAIT` seconds (10 by default) |
| `PreToolUse` on `Bash` | `guard-bash.sh` | Denies the git commands `AGENTS.md` → "Working copy" forbids, a commit or push to `main`, a push without a review receipt, `gh pr create` without `--title`, and a PR title CI would reject |
| `PreToolUse` on `Bash`, in reviewers | `reviewer-bash.sh` | Allows only commands that read or build, such as read-only `git` and `gh`, `rg`, `dotnet build` and `dotnet test`; denies the rest and every redirect into a file |
| `PreToolUse` on `LSP`, in reviewers | `reviewer-lsp.sh` | Allows only lookups; Copilot's `rename` writes the files |
| `PreToolUse` on edits | `guard-edit.sh` | Denies writes into `/tmp` and `issues/` |
| `PostToolUse` on `Bash` | `after-push.sh` | After a `git push`, reminds the agent once of each emulator or `build/` APK that appeared during the session |
| `SessionEnd` | `session-end.sh` | Removes the session's state in `.git/agent-hooks/` |

The hooks guard against mistakes, not intent: `guard-bash.sh` reads
simple commands and allows what it cannot read, while `reviewer-bash.sh`
denies it.

A hook is a bash script that needs only bash, `git`, `jq` and POSIX
tools, plus a fractional `sleep`, which macOS and GNU accept (`session-start.sh` also runs `dotnet` when installed). It writes
its verdict in both tools' JSON shapes and always exits 0, allowing the
call when `jq` is missing, because both tools block the call when a
`PreToolUse` hook fails. The settings command is
`"${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)}"/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh`:
quoted for paths with spaces, and found from the repository root when
`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is unset. `guard-bash.sh` copies CI's PR title rule.
The specs in `NodeRunner.Arch.Tests/Hooks/` run each hook against a
throwaway repository and check the registrations and the title rule.

## Merge gates

The `main` ruleset requires a PR, linear history, squash merges and the
checks `PR title`, `Build`, `Test & coverage` and `Format check`, with no
approval and no exceptions for administrators. Branches need not be up to
date with `main`, or auto-merge would stall whenever another PR lands
first; the CI run on `main` catches the rare semantic conflict.

## Auto-merge

Every PR enables squash auto-merge when it opens. The author does not
wait for the checks or the merge, but still owns the PR: when the next
task starts and before the session ends, check the PRs it opened and the
latest run on `main`, fix failing checks, and answer every review comment
with a fix or a reason; don't resolve threads you didn't address. If
auto-merge cannot be enabled, keep the PR open, report the blocker, and
never bypass the required checks. A PR into `release/vX.Y` is merged by
hand (`docs/RELEASING.md` → "Fix releases").

## PR title and commit hygiene

- Format: `type(#123): Description`, for example
  `feat(#11): Add feedforward neural network`. A PR closing several
  issues lists them: `refactor(#497, #498): Description`.
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`,
  `ci`, `perf`, `style`, `revert`.
- The description starts with an uppercase letter.
- The squash commit takes the PR title as its subject, so commits inside
  a PR may be messy.
- Add a `Co-authored-by:` trailer for every human or agent that
  contributed materially.
